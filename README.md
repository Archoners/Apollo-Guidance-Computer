# Apollo-Guidance-Computer

Want to create a computer inside java that can act like AGC.

Only thing not working is the output not being printed out in the terminal, use the 
    // System.out.println("Program Counter: " + programCounter);
    // System.out.println("Accumulator: " + accumulator);
    // System.out.println("Memory: " + Arrays.toString(memory));
    
to check that it works.
